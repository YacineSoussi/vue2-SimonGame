## Game rules

The objective of the game is to memorize an increasingly longer sequence of colors.

At the beginning of the game, there are four grey squares, each of which has a fixed color (red, yellow, green, and blue).

The steps of a new game are as follows:

1. Upon starting a new game, a color is randomly selected, and the corresponding square changes color.
2. Once the square returns to grey, the user must click on the square that just changed color.
3. Then, a new game round starts, and the score increases by 1.
4. The first square changes color, then a new color is selected, and another square changes color. The sequence is now two colors long.
5. The user must select the square of the first color, then the square of the second color.
6. Then, a new color (and the corresponding square) is added to the sequence, and so on.

An additional rule: the user must not click when a color is displayed, neither on another square nor anywhere else.
